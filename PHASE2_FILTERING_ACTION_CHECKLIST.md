## üìã READY FOR PRODUCTION

### Pre-Deployment Verification

1. **Smoke Test** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd discovery-assistant
   npm run dev
   ```
   - [ ] Create new meeting
   - [ ] Complete Phase 1 (at least Overview + Systems modules)
   - [ ] Generate proposal with services
   - [ ] Approve SUBSET of services (not all)
   - [ ] Transition to Phase 2
   - [ ] Verify RequirementsNavigator shows only purchased services
   - [ ] Verify SystemDeepDive shows only required systems
   - [ ] Check browser console for debug logs
   - [ ] Verify no errors in console

2. **Migration Test** (5 minutes)
   - [ ] Load old meeting from localStorage (if available)
   - [ ] Check browser console for migration logs
   - [ ] Verify `purchasedServices` field exists in meeting data
   - [ ] Check localStorage `discovery_migration_log` key

3. **Edge Case Spot Check** (5 minutes)
   - [ ] Create meeting with NO purchased services ‚Üí See empty state
   - [ ] Create meeting with NO AI services ‚Üí See warning banner in AI component
   - [ ] Create meeting with only 1 system ‚Üí Integration skips with warning

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Final TypeScript check
npm run build:typecheck

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Test production build locally
npm run preview

# 4. Deploy to staging (if available)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement Phase 2 service-based filtering

- Filter systems, integrations, and AI agents by purchased services
- Add acceptance criteria generation to Integration and AI components
- Implement data migration v4 for backward compatibility
- Fix TypeScript error in serviceRequirementsTemplates.ts

Closes #[ticket-number]"

git push origin main

# 5. Monitor staging deployment
# - Check Vercel deployment logs
# - Test deployed app on staging URL
# - Check browser console for errors

# 6. Deploy to production
# - Merge to production branch OR
# - Promote staging deployment to production
```

## üîç POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION

### Verify on Production (30 minutes)

1. **Create New Meeting**
   - [ ] Complete discovery with multiple services
   - [ ] Approve subset of services
   - [ ] Transition to Phase 2
   - [ ] Verify filtering works correctly

2. **Test Existing Meetings**
   - [ ] Open old meeting (if any exist)
   - [ ] Check for migration log in console
   - [ ] Verify `purchasedServices` field populated
   - [ ] Verify Phase 2 filtering works

3. **Test Edge Cases**
   - [ ] No purchased services ‚Üí Empty state shown
   - [ ] No AI services ‚Üí Warning banner shown
   - [ ] Only implementation services ‚Üí No AI shown

4. **Check Console Logs**
   - [ ] Look for "[SystemDeepDiveSelection]" logs
   - [ ] Look for "[IntegrationFlowBuilder]" logs
   - [ ] Look for "[AIAgentDetailedSpec]" logs
   - [ ] Look for "[DataMigration]" logs (if old meetings loaded)

5. **Verify Data Integrity**
   - [ ] Changes persist to localStorage
   - [ ] Meeting state updates correctly
   - [ ] No data loss after page refresh

## üìä MONITORING

### What to Watch (First 24 Hours)

1. **Browser Console Errors**
   - Monitor for any JavaScript errors
   - Check Sentry/error tracking (if configured)

2. **User Feedback**
   - Empty states are helpful and clear
   - Hebrew messaging is correct
   - Navigation flows make sense

3. **Performance**
   - Page load times remain fast
   - No lag when filtering large datasets

4. **Data Migration**
   - Old meetings migrate successfully
   - No data loss reported
   - Migration logs appear correctly

### Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Zero critical errors in production
- ‚úÖ All filtering logic working as expected
- ‚úÖ Old meetings migrate without issues
- ‚úÖ User feedback positive on new filtering
- ‚úÖ No performance degradation

## üÜò ROLLBACK PLAN (If Needed)

### Quick Rollback Steps

1. **Identify Issue**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Review error logs
   - Identify which component is failing

2. **Immediate Mitigation**
   ```bash
   # Revert last commit
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main

   # OR redeploy previous version
   # (depends on your deployment platform)
   ```

3. **Communicate**
   - Notify team of rollback
   - Document issue for future fix
   - Plan fix and re-deployment

### Known Safe Rollback Points

- **Last working version:** Commit before Phase 2 filtering implementation
- **Data migration:** Old meetings will still work (v3 data structure supported)
- **No data loss:** Migration is backward compatible

---

## üìù DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

### Update Project Docs (After Deployment)

- [ ] Update README.md with Phase 2 filtering feature
- [ ] Document service-to-system mapping process
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for filtering issues
- [ ] Document data migration v4 for future reference

### Team Handoff

- [ ] Share test reports with team
- [ ] Review console logging for debugging
- [ ] Explain edge case handling
- [ ] Document acceptance criteria integration

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (Future Enhancements)

### Priority 2: Nice to Have

1. **Add Unit Tests** (Vitest)
   - Test `getRequiredSystemsForServices()`
   - Test `getRequiredIntegrationsForServices()`
   - Test `getRequiredAIAgentsForServices()`
   - Test data migration v3‚Üív4
   - Test acceptance criteria generation

2. **Add E2E Tests** (Playwright)
   - Complete flow: Discovery ‚Üí Proposal ‚Üí Phase 2
   - Test filtering with various service combinations
   - Test edge cases (no services, no AI, etc.)

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add `useMemo` to filtering functions (if datasets grow)
   - Profile render performance with large datasets

4. **System Detail View**
   - Add acceptance criteria generation button to SystemDeepDive.tsx
   - Currently only in Integration and AI components

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**Before marking as complete:**

- [x] All 7 tasks implemented
- [x] TypeScript error fixed
- [x] Test report created
- [x] Edge cases documented
- [x] Debug logging comprehensive
- [ ] Smoke test passed
- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Post-deployment validation complete
- [ ] Team notified of changes

---

## üìû SUPPORT

**If issues arise:**

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for debug logs with component prefixes
   - Check for migration logs if loading old meetings

2. **Check localStorage**
   - Key: `discovery_migration_log` for migration history
   - Key: `discovery_current_meeting` for current meeting data

3. **Common Issues & Solutions**

   **Issue:** "No systems showing in SystemDeepDive"
   - **Check:** Are any services purchased? (`purchasedServices` not empty?)
   - **Check:** Do purchased services require systems? (Check serviceToSystemMapping.ts)
   - **Solution:** Verify services are correctly marked as purchased

   **Issue:** "Old meeting not working"
   - **Check:** Console for migration logs
   - **Check:** `meeting.dataVersion` should be 4 after migration
   - **Solution:** Check localStorage `discovery_migration_log` for errors

   **Issue:** "AI Agent warning shown but AI services purchased"
   - **Check:** Service category must be 'ai_agents'
   - **Check:** Console log for AI service filtering
   - **Solution:** Verify service category in SERVICES_DATABASE
