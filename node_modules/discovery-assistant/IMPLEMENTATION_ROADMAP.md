```bash
# Terminal 1
git checkout -b feature/automation-medium
# Services: #5, #6, #7, #10, #11, #14, #15, #19
# 2-4 days each, sequential within branch

# Terminal 2
git checkout -b feature/ai-conversational
# Services: #22, #23, #24
# 4-10 days each, sequential

# Terminal 3
git checkout -b feature/integration-crm
# Services: #36, #37, #38
# 2-4 days each, sequential

# Terminal 4
git checkout -b feature/system-impl-basic

# Terminal 3
git checkout -b feature/integration-complex
# Services: #32, #33, #34, #39, #40
# 3-10 days each
```

**Note**: If `feature/ai-advanced` (#25, #26, #28) becomes too complex, **pause other branches** and focus on AI advanced services alone.

# ERP and Custom Systems continue on their own timeline
```

---

## Git Branching Strategy

### **Branch Naming Convention**
```
feature/{category}-{complexity}
```

Examples:
- `feature/automation-basics`
- `feature/ai-simple`
- `feature/integration-complex`
- `feature/system-impl-major`

### **Commit Message Format**
```
feat: add {service-name} requirements

- TypeScript interface for {service-id}
- Requirements form component
- Validation logic
- Integration with Phase 2

Implements service #{number}
```

### **Merge Strategy**

**Option 1: Merge to Main (Recommended for small team)**
```bash
# After completing branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/automation-basics
npm run build:typecheck
npm run test
git push origin main
```

**Option 2: Pull Requests (Recommended for team)**
```bash
# After completing branch
git push origin feature/automation-basics
# Create PR on GitHub/GitLab
# Review ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Merge
```

**Option 3: Feature Flags (Advanced)**
```typescript
// For incomplete services, use feature flags
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  'service-21-ai-faq-bot': process.env.VITE_ENABLE_AI_FAQ_BOT === 'true',
  'service-45-impl-erp': process.env.VITE_ENABLE_ERP === 'true',
};

// In component
if (FEATURE_FLAGS['service-21-ai-faq-bot']) {
  return <AIFaqBotRequirements />;
}
```

## Conflict Matrix

### **High Conflict Pairs (Avoid Parallel Execution)**

| Service A | Service B | Conflict Type | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| #29 ai-full-integration | #30 ai-multi-agent | Type definitions | Both modify multi-agent orchestration types |
| #32 integration-complex | #33 int-complex | Orchestration logic | Both touch enterprise integration patterns |
| #12 auto-document-generation | #13 auto-document-mgmt | Document types | Shared document handling types |
| #17 auto-multi-system | #18 auto-end-to-end | Workflow types | Both modify complex workflow orchestration |
| #45 impl-erp | Any other service | Full focus required | ERP requires 100% attention, 6-18 months |

### **Medium Conflict Pairs (Can Run Parallel with Caution)**

| Service A | Service B | Conflict Type | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| #22 ai-lead-qualifier | #23 ai-sales-agent | AI conversation types | Use different file names, merge carefully |
| #35 int-crm-marketing | #36 int-crm-accounting | CRM integration types | Create shared `CRMIntegrationBase` type |
| #41 impl-crm | #42 impl-marketing-automation | System implementation types | Use namespaced types: `CRM.Config`, `Marketing.Config` |
| #50 data-cleanup | #51 data-migration | Data transformation types | Create shared `DataTransform` utilities |

### **Low Conflict Pairs (Safe Parallel Execution)**

| Service A | Service B | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| #1 auto-lead-response | #21 ai-faq-bot | Different domains: automation vs AI |
| #31 integration-simple | #47 impl-analytics | Different domains: integration vs system |
| #8 auto-form-to-crm | #55 training-workshops | Different domains: automation vs training |
| #52 add-dashboard | #58 consulting-process | Different domains: reporting vs consulting |

## Daily Checklist

### **Before Starting Work**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create/checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/{category}-{complexity}
# OR
git checkout feature/{existing-branch}

# Verify dev server not running
ps aux | grep "vite"  # Should be empty
```

### **During Implementation**
```bash
# Commit frequently (every 1-2 hours)
git add .
git commit -m "wip: {service-name} - {what you just did}"

# Run TypeScript check periodically
npm run build:typecheck

# Test the component
npm run dev
# Navigate to Phase 2 ‚Üí Service Requirements ‚Üí Test your new form
```

### **After Completing Service**
```bash
# Final commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete {service-name} requirements

- TypeScript interface
- Requirements form
- Validation logic
- Integration with Phase 2

Implements service #{number}"

# Run full build
npm run build:typecheck
npm run test  # If tests exist

# Push to remote (if using PRs)
git push origin feature/{branch-name}

# OR merge to main (if working solo)
git checkout main
git merge feature/{branch-name}
git push origin main
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Conflicts

### **Conflict 1: TypeScript Type Conflicts**
```typescript
// BAD: Two branches define same type differently
// Branch A:
interface ServiceConfig {
  apiKey: string;
}

// Branch B:
interface ServiceConfig {
  apiToken: string;
}

// SOLUTION: Use service-specific types
interface AutoLeadResponseConfig {
  apiKey: string;
}

interface AIFaqBotConfig {
  apiToken: string;
}
```

### **Conflict 2: Component Import Conflicts**
```typescript
// BAD: Both branches modify same import
import { ServiceRequirementsForm } from './ServiceRequirements';

// SOLUTION: Use specific imports
import { AutoLeadResponseForm } from './ServiceRequirements/AutoLeadResponseForm';
import { AIFaqBotForm } from './ServiceRequirements/AIFaqBotForm';
```

### **Conflict 3: Merge Conflicts in serviceRequirements.ts**
```bash
# When merging branches with type definition conflicts

# Step 1: Accept both changes
git checkout main
git merge feature/automation-basics
# CONFLICT in src/types/serviceRequirements.ts

# Step 2: Manually merge
# Open src/types/serviceRequirements.ts
# Keep ALL interface definitions
# Remove duplicate imports

# Step 3: Verify build
npm run build:typecheck

# Step 4: Commit merge
git add .
git commit -m "merge: resolve serviceRequirements.ts conflicts"
```

## Emergency Procedures

### **If You Get Completely Stuck**
```bash
# Option 1: Stash changes and start fresh
git stash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/{service}-attempt2

# Option 2: Create backup branch
git checkout -b feature/{service}-backup
git checkout feature/{service}
git reset --hard HEAD~5  # Go back 5 commits

# Option 3: Ask for help (create issue)
# Document:
# - Service number
# - What you tried
# - Error messages
# - Steps to reproduce
```

### **If Merge Conflicts Are Too Complex**
```bash
# Abort merge
git merge --abort

# Try rebase instead
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/{branch}
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts one commit at a time
git rebase --continue

# If still stuck, merge one file at a time
git checkout main
git checkout feature/{branch} -- src/types/serviceRequirements.ts
git add .
git commit -m "merge: add serviceRequirements.ts from feature/{branch}"
```
