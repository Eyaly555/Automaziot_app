- Patterns to replicate for remaining services

---

### 7. Systems Auth Database (if exists)

## üìä Reading Order (Recommended)

### Step 1: Understand the Service Catalog
Read: `servicesDatabase.ts`
Goal: Get complete list of 59 services and their basic info

### Step 2: See What's Already Covered
Read: `serviceRequirementsTemplates.ts`
Goal: Understand what information is already being collected for 18 services

### Step 3: Understand Phase 2 Data Structures
Read: `phase2.ts`
Goal: Know exactly what fields exist for systems, integrations, AI agents, acceptance criteria

### Step 4: Understand Phase 1 Data Available
Read: `index.ts` (Meeting and module types)
Goal: Know what information is already collected and available

### Step 5: See Pre-fill Logic Patterns
Read: `requirementsPrefillEngine.ts`
Goal: Understand how to map Phase 1 data to Phase 2 needs

### Step 6: Understand Service Selection Logic
Read: `proposalEngine.ts`
Goal: Understand why services are suggested and their relationships

## üéØ Key Questions to Answer While Reading

### About Each Service:
1. What does this service actually do?
2. Is there a requirements template for it already?
3. What systems does it interact with?
4. What Phase 1 data is relevant?
5. What technical details are missing?

### About Systems:
1. Which systems are commonly needed? (CRM, email, WhatsApp, etc.)
2. What authentication methods do they use?
3. What modules/objects do we typically access?
4. Do they require data migration?

### About Integrations:
1. What are common integration patterns? (form‚ÜíCRM, CRM‚Üíemail, etc.)
2. What triggers make sense? (webhook, schedule, new_record)
3. What error handling is needed?
4. What frequency is typical?

### About AI Agents:
1. Which services actually need AI agents?
2. What department focus? (sales, service, operations)
3. What knowledge sources are needed?
4. What integrations does the AI need?

### About Acceptance Criteria:
1. How do we measure success for each service?
2. What are realistic performance targets?
3. What security requirements are standard?
4. What makes good usability?

## üìù Notes for AI Generation

### Don't Duplicate
- If something is already in the requirements template, DON'T add it to additionalTechnicalFields
- Only add technical fields that developers need but aren't in the questionnaire

### Be Specific
- "CRM system" is too vague ‚Üí specify Zoho/HubSpot/Salesforce
- "Email integration" ‚Üí specify Gmail/Outlook and what data syncs
- "AI agent" ‚Üí specify department, knowledge sources, intents

### Think Dependencies
- WhatsApp Automation ‚Üí needs CRM (for lead data)
- AI Sales Agent ‚Üí needs CRM (for customer history)
- Advanced Reporting ‚Üí needs systems with data

### Consider Prerequisites
- WhatsApp ‚Üí needs approved templates
- AI Agent ‚Üí needs knowledge base content
- Data Migration ‚Üí needs source system API access

## ‚úÖ Validation Before Generation

Before generating the mapping, confirm:
- [ ] You've read all 59 services from servicesDatabase.ts
- [ ] You understand the 18 existing requirements templates
- [ ] You know the Phase 2 data structures from phase2.ts
- [ ] You know what Phase 1 data is available from index.ts
- [ ] You've seen the pre-fill patterns from requirementsPrefillEngine.ts
- [ ] You understand service relationships from proposalEngine.ts

---

## üöÄ Ready to Generate

Once you've read these files and understand the patterns, you're ready to generate the complete `serviceToSystemMapping.ts` file with all 59 services mapped according to the framework in `PHASE2_MAPPING_PROMPT.md`.
