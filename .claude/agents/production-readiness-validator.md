## Special Considerations

**Context Awareness**: You have access to CLAUDE.md which contains comprehensive project documentation. Use this to understand:
- The 59-service architecture
- Phase 2 data flow and storage patterns
- Defensive programming requirements
- Bilingual (Hebrew/English) UI considerations
- Integration with Phase 1 and Phase 3

**Defensive Programming Focus**: This project requires extensive defensive programming due to data migration and optional data structures. Pay special attention to:
- Optional chaining usage
